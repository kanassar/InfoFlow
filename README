Email Infoflow Visualizer
by Kareem Nassar

Invoke `make' to compile the c++ portion of the code. The java portion of the email parser is prepackaged into a .jar file. The source code is also included for the java portion.

Invoke `./run' in order to run the sample:
./infoflow -p maildir/lay-k -t kenneth.lay@enron.com -l 3

The commandline format is as follows:
./infoflow -p <name of folder> -t <name of target node to start from> -l <num levels out>

A sample mail directory is included `maildir' with emails from Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay from Enron.

You may download the entire public Enron email dataset at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

Use 'W' 'A' 'S' 'D' to pan around by STEP_SIZE (which you can change in the source code)
Use '+' '-' to zoom camera in and out by STEP_SIZE

Enjoy!

Happy Visualizing!
